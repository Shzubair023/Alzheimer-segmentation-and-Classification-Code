# Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Hybrid Deep Learning with Multi-Layer U-Net and XAI

This repository contains the complete code and project modules used for the paper:

**"Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach with Multi-Layer U-Net Segmentation and XAI Driven Analysis"**

## üî¨ Project Overview

The proposed method includes:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project
Segmentation:

Unzip Segmentation.zip

Run brain_segmentation.py for skull stripping

Run gm_segmentation.py for gray matter segmentation using Multi-Layer U-Net

Classification:

Unzip Classification.zip

Run the EfficientNet + SVM pipeline in classification_model.py

Explainable AI:

Unzip Explainable AI.zip

Run xai_saliency_map.py to visualize saliency on segmented gray matter

Modify to switch between AD, MCI, and CN classes

üìä Dataset
The dataset used is from the ADNI database. For reproducibility:

Gray matter masks were created via segmentation.

Data was split into 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test.

Note: Due to ADNI's licensing, the dataset itself is not included here. You must request access via: https://ida.loni.usc.edu
